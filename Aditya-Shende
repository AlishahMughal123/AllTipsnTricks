I was testing for ATO via reset function . Tried all method but no success. My friend 
@Tabnexa
  gave me tip to add  double Host in request while requesting password

Host: http://site.com
Host: http://evilsite.com

Boom it worked 

Resource ->
https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/17-Testing_for_Host_Header_Injection

Read this and there are multiple bypasses on h1 .

What did you achieved by add double host? -> Password Reset Poisoning

What are the other things we can try??

I tried this method, permuting email and token, adding extra email, X-Forwarded Headers, X-Host header,  HPP... What else can we do???

Host,   X F H ,Vice versa of them....

ATO -> Account Takeover
XFH -> X-Forwarded-For
