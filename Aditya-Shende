I was testing for ATO via reset function . Tried all method but no success. My friend 
@Tabnexa
  gave me tip to add  double Host in request while requesting password

Host: http://site.com
Host: http://evilsite.com

Boom it worked 

Resource ->
https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/17-Testing_for_Host_Header_Injection

Read this and there are multiple bypasses on h1 .

What did you achieved by add double host? -> Password Reset Poisoning

What are the other things we can try??

I tried this method, permuting email and token, adding extra email, X-Forwarded Headers, X-Host header,  HPP... What else can we do???

Host,   X F H ,Vice versa of them....

ATO -> Account Takeover
XFH -> X-Forwarded-For

Accidental finding (4 days ago)
In site article they mentioned "If you have any queries, You can raise ticket on http://site.atlassian.net"

1. When I clicked on link : Doesn't exist
2. So I created the domain as they mentioned (http://site.atlassian.net)
3. But no information....
4. So I thought to check domain again.
5. In recent tickets I found 7 raised queries . Some of them mentioned their personal information

Quick report to company

Reference -> https://medium.com/@intideceukelaire/hundreds-of-internal-servicedesks-exposed-due-to-covid-19-ecd0baec87bd

Summary :-> 
He saw an ad and visited that link. But it's empty, so he created that subdomain site(by using rouge cname). Few customers visited his site and submitted personal info for tickets. He submitted that to company as it's a privacy policy violation
